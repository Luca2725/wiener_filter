# wiener_filter
Wiener filter for A4A project

There is a code for audio in .wav format and a code for a realtime audio signal.

The audio.wav is an audio that contains noise and that, after being processed by "filtro_wiener_para_ficheiros.py",
the noise is eliminated and a new audio file called "audio_sem_ruido.wav" is created.

For the filter to run in real time, another code is used, present in the "c_gain_control_skeleton_pyaudio_mike2line_luis" folder.
